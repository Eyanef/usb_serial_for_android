# usb_serial_for_android

Serial lib for android devices.

## IMPORTANT!

This project is very similar to [usb_serial](https://github.com/altera2015/usbserial), you can use its documentation to use this library. There are still many changes and tests that I must perform

## Motivation

I had some problems and bugs using usb_serial due to the special requirements of a project I was working on.

While usb_serial uses https://github.com/felHR85/UsbSerial
To support its functionality, this library uses https://github.com/mik3y/usb-serial-for-android
